## CA1: Genetic Algorithm

Solve the pseudo knapsack problem using a Genetic algorithm.
the problem is about snacks and their weight and values in which they should satisfy some of the parameters and we try to model it using a genetic algorithm and find the best answer.

## CA2: Hidden Markov Models 

Implement a number speech recognition system with HMM. we have a dataset of English numbers from 1 to 9 that have several speakers who repeat each number 50 times; here we use two ways to apply our Hidden Markov Model, first, we Implement it with Libraries then we Implement it from Scratch and without using the built-in library. we will apply our HMM with target var first with digit label and Speaker Name.

## CA3: Clustering

Analyze the images of several different flowers by using clustering algorithms and try to put them in different categories using the data we have, so that after applying the clustering algorithm As much as possible, they are placed in their right cluster.


## CA4: Regression & Classification

Have a dataset that includes information related to the price of houses in Boston along with the characteristics of the houses. In this project, we want to understand the criteria and dependencies by analyzing the characteristics of houses and be able to understand the price of houses based on their characteristics using Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Ensemble methods, XGBoost, SVM and finally analyzing the models.


## CA5: Convolutional Neural Networks

Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting suicidal tendencies in Twitter posts, aiming to categorize tweets into two classes: indicative of suicidal intent or not. By leveraging CNNs, which excel at capturing patterns in data, we adapted their architecture for text analysis. The model uses convolutional layers to extract key features from the text, followed by feed-forward layers for classification. Through this project, we explored the effectiveness of CNNs in text classification and optimized the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

## CA6: Reinforcement Learning

Implements a Q-learning agent to play the classic Snake game. The agent learns to navigate the game environment, maximize rewards by eating snacks, and avoid collisions with the game boundaries and itself. The primary goal of this project is to create a self-learning Snake game agent that improves its performance over time through reinforcement learning. It demonstrates the application of Q-learning in a dynamic and interactive environment.
